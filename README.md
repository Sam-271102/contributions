If you are adding yourself to this log, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repo to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your new repo to your computer.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/BrickMMO/contributions.git
    cd contributions
    ```
    
3. Using an existing student pages as an example, create a page named `<GITHUB_USERNAME>.markdown` and put it in the `students` folder. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can use `<LINKEDIN_USERNAME>.markdown`. For example my page would be named `codeadam.markdown`.

    > You can check our my page as an example:  
    > [https://contributions.brickmmo.com/faculty/codeadamca](https://contributions.brickmmo.com/faculty/codeadamca)

    > Or you can view the Markdown here:  
    > [https://github.com/BrickMMO/contributions/blob/main/faculty/codeadamca.markdown](https://github.com/BrickMMO/contributions/blob/main/faculty/codeadamca.markdown)

4. Add an image to the `images` folder named `<GITHUB_USERNAME>.jpg`. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can use you `<LINKEDIN_USERNAME>.png`. The syntax to add your image to your page is:

   ```markdown
   ![<GITHUB_USERNAME>](images/<GITHUB_USERNAME>.jpg)
   ```

   For example, mine would look something like this:

   ```markdown
   ![codeadamca](images/codeadam.png)
   ```

   Images are 80 x 80 pixels. Images can be png, jpg, or gif.
   
5. Add your information to your new page. You might want to include the following information:

    - First and last name
    - GutHub link
    - LinkedIn link
    - Other social links (Instagram, Twitter, Flickr, LinkTree, YouTube)
    - Link to your portfolio
    - Profile image

6. Add a table with a list of BrickMMO projects you have contributed to. Look at other contributor pages for an example. At this point just include the `Tasks` project:

   ```markdown
   | Project |                                                                                  |
   | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | Flow    | [https://brickmmo.github.io/flow-about/](https://brickmmo.github.io/flow-about/) |
   | Tasks   | [https://tasks.brickmmo.com/](https://tasks.brickmmo.com/)                       |
   ```
   
7. Using an existing class page as an example, add your name to each appropriate list. Link your name to your student page. For example my student page would be `students/codeadam`. Notice the `markdown` extension is not required.

    ```markdown
    | ![Adam Thomas](images/codeadamca.png) | Adam Thomas | [codeadamca](students/codeadamca) |
    ```
    
8. Submit a pull request.
